    <h1>iPhone</h1>
    <p>
      iOS (formerly iPhone OS[10]) is a mobile operating system developed by
      Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware. It is the operating system that
      powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the iPhone; the
      term also includes the system software for iPads predating iPadOS—which
      was introduced in 2019—as well as on the iPod Touch devices—which were
      discontinued in mid-2022.[11] It is the world's second-most widely
      installed mobile operating system, after Android. It is the basis for
      three other operating systems made by Apple: iPadOS, tvOS, and
      watchOS.[12] It is proprietary software, although some parts of it are
      open source under the Apple Public Source License and other licenses.[13]
      Unveiled in 2007 for the first-generation iPhone, iOS has since been
      extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPod Touch (September
      2007) and the iPad (introduced: January 2010; availability: April 2010.)
      As of March 2018, Apple's App Store contains more than 2.1 million iOS
      applications, 1 million of which are native for iPads.[14] These mobile
      apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times. Major
      versions of iOS are released annually. The current stable version, iOS 16,
      was released to the public on September 12, 2022.[15]
